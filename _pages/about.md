Hello! I'm Tiago, born in 1994 and originally from Brazil, Salvador - BA. I studied electrical engineering, which led me to an exciting career working with embedded automotive systems. My passion for engineering and technology drives my professional life, allowing me to contribute to innovations in the automotive industry. My interest throughout my career is to make a difference by creating useful software and solutions. For more professional info, check out my [CV](/cv)

A significant chapter of my life was spent in Sofia, Bulgaria, where I lived for four years. This experience broadened my horizons and enriched my cultural understanding, shaping me both personally and professionally. You can check some of my trip on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lobao_tiago/)

Beyond my work, music are related to most of my hobbies. Whether it's playing an instrument, listening to my favorite tracks, or dancing, music is an integral part of who I am. (Still pending to create more content about it).
